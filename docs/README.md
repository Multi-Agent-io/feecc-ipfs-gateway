# Feecc IPFS Gateway

Feecc IPFS Gateway is a microservice, designed to publish files to IPFS and Pinata Cloud. It also lets you publish file CIDs to Robonomics network datalog.

It provides a simple REST API interface to publish files either by their paths on the host or by providing them in a request body as multipart form data. It also handles user authentication.

Feecc IPFS Gateway comes as a part of the Feecc, a Web3 enabled production tracking system.

IPFS Gateway is a microservice that is written in asynchronous Python using FastAPI framework and HTTPX library.

## Deployment

The app is supposed to be run in a Docker container and can be configured by setting several environment variables.

> Note, that we assume a Linux host in this guide, however you can also run IPFS Gateway on any other OS, but be warned: timezone is defined by mounting host `/etc/timezone` and `/etc/localtime` files inside the container,  which are not present on Windows machines, so you might end up with UTC time inside your container.

Start by cloning the git repository onto your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-ipfs-gateway.git
```

Enter the app directory and modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to your needs by changing the environment variables (discussed in the configuration part).

```
cd feecc-ipfs-gateway
vim docker-compose.yml
```

When you are done configuring your installation, build and start the container using docker-compose:
```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Verify your deployment by going to http://127.0.0.1:8082/docs in your browser. You should see the SwaggerUI API specification page. Continue from there.

## Configuration

To configure your IPFS Gateway deployment edit the environment variables, provided in `docker-compose.yml` file.

Environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection URI ending with `/db-name`.
- `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` - Leave null if you want testing credentials to work, otherwise set it to `true`.
- `LOCAL_IPFS_ENABLED`- Whether to enable local IPFS node publishing or not. Defaults to `false`.
- `PINATA_ENABLED`- Whether to upload files to Pinata.cloud or not. Defaults to `false`.
- `PINATA_API`- Pinata.cloud credentials. Leave empty if you don't need it.
- `PINATA_SECRET_API` - Pinata.cloud credentials. Leave empty if you don't need it.
- `ROBONOMICS_ENABLE_DATALOG`- Whether to post CIDs to Robonomics network datalog or not. Defaults to `false`.
- `ROBONOMICS_SUBSTRATE_NODE_URL` - Robonomics node URL in case you want to use a non-default node.
- `ROBONOMICS_ACCOUNT_SEED`- Robonomics network account seed. Leave empty if you don't need it.
- `AUTH_MODE`- Authentication mode. Available options are "analytics" (auth by analytics login), "workbench" (auth by card id) and "noauth" (auth w/o credentials).
